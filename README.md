# Inbot Stellar Kotlin Wrapper

The Inbot Stellar Kotlin Wrapper wraps the official Stellar java sdk with some Kotlin specific goodness. The intent is to get rid of a lot of boilerplate and make it easy to create accounts, work with a standalone container, and do transactions.

**This is a work in progress.** APIs may change, refactoring may happen, etc. When this changes we'll remove this notice.
